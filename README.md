# - recorded simultaneously with the fMRI data acquisition using a custom setup25 and in-house recording software (written in Python). A Nonin 8600 FO pulse oxymeter (Nonin Medical, Inc, Plymouth, MN, USA) was used to measure cardiac trace and oxygen s\
aturation, and a Siemens respiratory belt connected to a pressure sensor (Honeywell 40PC001B1A) captured the respiratory trace. Analog signals were digitized (12 bit analog digital converter, National Instruments USB-6008) at a sampling rate of 200 Hz.\
 The digitizer also logged the volume acquisition trigger pulse emitted by the MRI scanner.
